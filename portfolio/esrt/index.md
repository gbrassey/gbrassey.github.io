The Mechanism has maintained this project since building it in 2008. In the fall of 2013 we handled the changeover of Malkin Properties and it's affiliated websites during their IPO and rebranding as ESRT.

I managed all technical aspects of the changeover (server, migrating git repositories and refactoring code) with zero downtime, ready for the market bell, the morning their stock floated along with designing and implementing the photo slider on the homepage and other CMS extensions.

Since managing this property, I have been progressively enhanced it with the incorporation of new tools and standards to keep the website modern.

### Technologies:

* PHP (CodeIgniter)
* MySQL
* JavaScript (jQuery)

The Mechanism was engaged to extend this existing tool built for the NYC Campaign Finance Board (CFB) with three goals:

* Simplify the reporting process for contributions made through the app to the CFB’s C-SMART service (a requirement for all NYC elections)
* <a href="https://developers.google.com/civic-information/" title="Google Civic Information API" rel="external">Google Civic Information API integration</a>
* Responsive Site Design (the first iteration was built as a mobile webapp)

This project has entailed extensive brainstorming with the CFB to identify solutions to the existing app. In addition to overseeing the development department during strategy and scheduling.

We have continued development of the open source OpenVotes application, with the intention that this will be made available to other cities.

The project is ongoing

This website, the first built after a 5 year hiatus while working in the film industry was a portfolio piece, demonstrated my emergent ability as a Web Developer.

Designed and built from scratch with the use of few libraries and frameworks, was an excellent opportunity to learn the basics of Web Development.

The simple and fun design showcases the books of this children's author and is powered by a custom CMS.

Innovations include the use of AJAX to limit the website to a single page.

### Technologies:

* PHP
* MySQL
* JavaScript (jQuery)

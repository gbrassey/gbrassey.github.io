The goal of this project was to create an immersive eLearning platform to train pharmaceutical sales teams. With content written by another company, The Mechanism developed this project to be SCORM compliant using HTML5 web technologies.

I lead the development team of 3 as well as collaborated with client during design and functional specifications to ensure the best experience for users.

We built an extensive JavaScript library to create an immersive iPad experience that affords swipe interactions between pages.

The response from client was a resounding success. Described as: "easily the best looking and most interactive eLearning module we currently have." & "This now sets the standard moving forward for quality of modules."

The goal of this project was to create an immersive eLearning platform for training pharmaceutical sales teams. With technical content written by another company, The Mechanism developed this project using HTML5 web technologies to be SCORM compliant.

I lead a development team of 3 during a swift development cycle as well as collaborated with client during design and functional specifications to ensure best the experience for users.

We built a JavaScript library to create an immersive iPad experience that afforded a swipe interaction between pages.

The response from client was a resounding success. Described as: "easily the best looking and most interactive eLearning module we currently have." & "This now sets the standard moving forward for quality of modules."

### Technologies:

* JavaScript (jQuery)
* SASS

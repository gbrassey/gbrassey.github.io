The Mechanism took on this project as a chance to implement our open source <a href="https://github.com/theMechanism/The-Social-Mechanism" rel="external">Social Mechanism</a>, a tool for collating social media from multiple sources.

As a band with an active social media presence and little time to learn a new content management system, this solution requires no additional maintenance by the band and expands their audience.

I conceived the layout and refactored existing code to bring it up to prodcution standard. It was also a chance to deploy our first Node.js project on a No-SQL database.

### Technologies:

* Node.js
* Mongodb
* Express
* API integration with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube

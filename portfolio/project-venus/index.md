This tool originated after identifying a hassle for our clients during User Assisted Testing (UAT). Scalable and simple to implement, it allows users to report potential issues to our developers quickly and efficiently.

By collecting contextual information in the background, the user is shielded from the trivialties of reporting. As well as providing our developers with the relevant detail they need to debug the issue.

Having realized a fast prototype, I led product development through wireframing, design and programming. The solution has since been rolled out to clients.

This project is a simple yet elegant solution to a task that can otherwise be tedious and repetetive.
